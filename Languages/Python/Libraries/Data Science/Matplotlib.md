# Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing to generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, error charts, scatter plots, etc.

## Installation

To install Matplotlib, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Basic Usage

Here is a simple example of how to create a basic line plot:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

# Create a plot
plt.plot(x, y)

# Add a title
plt.title('Simple Line Plot')

# Add labels to the axes
plt.xlabel('X Axis')
plt.ylabel('Y Axis')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

## Key Features

- **Plotting**: Create a wide variety of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and more.
- **Customization**: Customize plots with titles, labels, legends, and annotations.
- **Interactivity**: Create interactive plots that can be embedded in web applications.
- **Integration**: Works well with other libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy.
