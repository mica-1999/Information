# Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, which provide pre-designed components, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.

## Key Features

- **Utility-First**: Tailwind's utility-first approach means you can apply styles directly in your HTML using utility classes.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind includes responsive design utilities that make it easy to build responsive layouts.
- **Customization**: Tailwind is highly customizable. You can configure your design system and extend the framework with your own custom utilities.
- **Performance**: Tailwind's approach can lead to smaller CSS files in production because it only includes the styles you actually use.

## Example

Here is an example of a simple button using Tailwind CSS:

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
    Button
</button>
```

In this example:
- `bg-blue-500` sets the background color.
- `hover:bg-blue-700` changes the background color on hover.
- `text-white` sets the text color.
- `font-bold` makes the text bold.
- `py-2` and `px-4` set the padding.
- `rounded` gives the button rounded corners.

## Getting Started

To get started with Tailwind CSS, you can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss
```

Then, create a configuration file:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

Finally, include Tailwind in your CSS:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
